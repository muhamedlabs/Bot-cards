Explanation:

The bot is created using the commands.Bot class from the discord.py library.
The user_profiles dictionary is used to store user profiles. Each profile is associated with the user's ID.
The create_profile command allows users to create their profile by providing their name, age, and interests.
The show_profile command displays the profile of a specified user or the author of the command if no user is mentioned.
